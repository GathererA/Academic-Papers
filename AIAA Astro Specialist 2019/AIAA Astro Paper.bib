Based only on sequences of depth images along with action vectors and point wise data associations, SE3-Nets learn to segment effected object parts and predict their motion resulting from the applied force. Rather than learning point wise flow vectors, SE3-Nets predict SE3 transformations for different parts of the scene. Using simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we show that the structure underlying SE3-Nets enables them to generate a far more consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks. Additional experiments with a depth camera observing a Baxter robot pushing objects on a table show that SE3-Nets also work well on real data.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM{${_\ast}$} and RRT{${_\ast}$}, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

The method works by incrementally building two Rapidly-exploring Random Bees (RRTs) rooted at the start and the goal configurations. The trees each explore space around them and also advance towards each other through the use of a simple greedy heuristic. Although originally designed to plan motions for a human arm (modeled as a '7-DOF kinematic chain) for the automatic graphic animation of collision-free grasping and manipulation tasks, the algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of path planning problems. Computed examples include generating collision-free motions for rigid objects in 2D and 30, and collision-free manipulation motions for a 6-DOF PUMA arm in a 3 0 workspace. Some basic theoretical analysis is also presented.},

  abstract = {The past decade has seen the rise of various radio astronomy arrays, particularly for low-frequency observations below 100MHz. These developments have been primarily driven by interesting and fundamental scientific questions, such as studying the dark ages and epoch of re-ionization, by detecting the highly red-shifted 21cm line emission. However, Earth-based radio astronomy below frequencies of 30MHz is severely restricted due to man-made interference, ionospheric distortion and almost complete non-transparency of the ionosphere below 10MHz. Therefore, this narrow spectral band remains possibly the last unexplored frequency range in radio astronomy. A straightforward solution to study the universe at these frequencies is to deploy a space-based antenna array far away from Earths' ionosphere. Various studies in the past were principally limited by technology and computing resources, however current processing and communication trends indicate otherwise. We briefly present the achievable science cases, and discuss the system design for selected scenarios, such as extra-galactic surveys. An extensive discussion is presented on various sub-systems of the potential satellite array, such as radio astronomical antenna design, the on-board signal processing, communication architectures and joint space-time estimation of the satellite network. In light of a scalable array and to avert single point of failure, we propose both centralized and distributed solutions for the ULW space-based array. We highlight the benefits of various deployment locations and summarize the technological challenges for future space-based radio arrays.},

The algorithm is based on a linear quadratic approximation of an exponential risk sensitive nonlinear control problem. ILEG allows to find risk sensitive policies and thus generalizes previous algorithms to solve nonlinear optimal control based on iterative linear-quadratic methods. Depending on the setting of the parameter controlling the risk sensitivity, two different strategies on how to cope with the risk emerge. For positive-value parameters, the control policy uses high feedback gains whereas for negative-value parameters, it uses a robust feedforward control strategy (a robust plan) with low gains. These results are illustrated with a simple example. This note should be considered as a preliminary report.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to trajectory optimization for autonomous fixed-wing aerial vehicles performing large-scale maneuvers. The main result is a planner which designs nearly minimum time planar trajectories to a goal, constrained by no-fly zones and the vehicle's maximum speed and turning rate. Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is used for the optimization, and is well suited to trajectory optimization because it can incorporate logical constraints, such as no-fly zone avoidance, and continuous constraints, such as aircraft dynamics. MILP is applied over a receding planning horizon to reduce the computational effort of the planner and to incorporate feedback. In this approach, MILP is used to plan short trajectories that extend towards the goal, but do not necessarily reach it. The cost function accounts for decisions beyond the planning horizon by estimating the time to reach the goal from the plan's end point. This time is estimated by searching a graph representation of the environment. This approach is shown to avoid entrapment behind obstacles, to yield near-optimal performance when comparison with the minimum arrival time found using a fixed horizon controller is possible, and to work consistently on large trajectory optimization problems that are intractable for the fixed horizon controller.},

  abstract = {Radio astronomical observations are increasingly contaminated by man-made RF interference (RFI). If these signals are continuously present, then they cannot be removed by the usual techniques of detection and blanking. We have previously proposed a spatial filtering technique, where the impact of the interferer is projected out from the estimated covariance data. Assuming that the spatial signature of the interferer is time-varying, several such estimates can be combined to recover the missing dimensions. In this paper, we give a detailed performance analysis of this algorithm. It is shown that the spatial filter introduces a small increase in variance of the estimates (because of the loss in information) and that the algorithm is unbiased in case the true spatial signatures of the interferers are known but that there may be a bias in case the signatures are estimated from the same data. Some of the bias may be removed, and moreover, the bias only affects the auto-correlations, whereas the astronomical information is mostly in the cross-correlations.},

  abstract = {Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-to-end LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University.},

When changes are detected in the workspace, the validity state of affected edges and nodes of a precompiled roadmap are updated accordingly. We concentrate in this paper on analyzing the tradeoffs between maintaining dynamic roadmaps and applying an on-line bidirectional rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) planner alone, which requires no preprocessing or maintenance. We ground the analysis in several benchmarks in virtual environments with randomly moving obstacles. Different robotics structures are used, including a 17 degrees of freedom model of NASA's Robonaut humanoid. Our results show that dynamic roadmaps can be both faster and more capable for planning difficult motions than using on-line planning alone. In particular, we investigate its scalability to 3D workspaces and higher dimensional configurations spaces, as our main interest is the application of the method to interactive domains involving humanoids.},

A planar dynamic model is used to evaluate pitch-up maneuvers and determine suspension parameters that satisfy constraints on the contact forces for a range of flight velocities. Simulations conducted using the model are compared with data obtained using high-speed video and a force plate embedded in a wall.},

LQG-MP is based on the linear-quadratic controller with Gaussian models of uncertainty, and explicitly characterizes in advance (i.e. before execution) the a priori  probability distributions of the state of the robot along its path. These distributions can be used to assess the quality of the path, for instance by computing the probability of avoiding collisions. Many methods can be used to generate the required ensemble of candidate paths from which the best path is selected; in this paper we report results using rapidly exploring random trees (RRT). We study the performance of LQG-MP with simulation experiments in three scenarios: (A) a kinodynamic car-like robot, (B) multi-robot planning with differential-drive robots, and (C) a 6-DOF serial manipulator. We also present a method that applies Kalman smoothing to make paths Ck-continuous and apply LQG-MP to precomputed roadmaps using a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently find high-quality paths.},

Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a selection of new results from the commissioning phase of this new radio observatory.},

  abstract = {Current linear-time simulation methods for articulated figures are based exclusively on reduced-coordinate formulations. This paper describes a general, non-iterative linear-time simulation method based instead on Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange multiplier methods are important for computer graphics applications because they bypass the difficult (and often intractable) problem of parameterizing a system's degrees of freedom. Given a loop-free set of n equality constraints acting between pairs of bodies, the method takes O(n) time to compute the system's dynamics. The method does not rely on matrix bandwidth, so no assumptions about the constraints' topology are needed. Bodies need not be rigid, constraints can be of various dimensions, and unlike reduced-coordinate approaches, nonholonomic (e.g. velocity-dependent) constraints are allowed. An additional set of k one-dimensional constraints which induce loops and/or handle inequalities can be accommodated with cost O(kn). This makes it practical to simulate complicated, closedloop articulated figures with joint-limits and contact at interactive rates. A complete description of a sample implementation is provided in pseudocode.},

  title = {Incremental {{Sampling}}-Based {{Algorithms}} for {{Optimal Motion Planning}}},
  abstract = {During the last decade, incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), have been shown to work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of the solution obtained by these algorithms, e.g., in terms of a given cost function, have been established so far. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by designing efficient incremental samplingbased algorithms with provable optimality properties. The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path returned by RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value, as the number of samples increases. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path returned by RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called RRT*{$\dottedsquare$}, which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the number of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT{$\dottedsquare$}* algorithms is asymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT.},

  abstract = {The availability of position information is of great importance in many commercial, governmental, and military applications. Localization is commonly accomplished through the use of radio communication between mobile devices (agents) and fixed infrastructure (anchors). However, precise determination of agent positions is a challenging task, especially in harsh environments due to radio blockage or limited anchor deployment. In these situations, cooperation among agents can significantly improve localization accuracy and reduce localization outage probabilities. A general framework of analyzing the fundamental limits of wideband localization has been developed in Part I of the paper. Here, we build on this framework and establish the fundamental limits of wideband cooperative location-aware networks. Our analysis is based on the waveforms received at the nodes, in conjunction with Fisher information inequality. We provide a geometrical interpretation of equivalent Fisher information (EFI) for cooperative networks. This approach allows us to succinctly derive fundamental performance limits and their scaling behaviors, and to treat anchors and agents in a unified way from the perspective of localization accuracy. Our results yield important insights into how and when cooperation is beneficial.},

  abstract = {Interior methods are an omnipresent, conspicuous feature of the constrained optimization landscape today, but it was not always so. Primarily in the form of barrier methods, interior-point techniques were popular during the 1960s for solving nonlinearly constrained problems. However, their use for linear programming was not even contemplated because of the total dominance of the simplex method. Vague but continuing anxiety about barrier methods eventually led to their abandonment in favor of newly emerging, apparently more efficient alternatives such as augmented Lagrangian and sequential quadratic programming methods. By the early 1980s, barrier methods were almost without exception regarded as a closed chapter in the history of optimization.  This picture changed dramatically with Karmarkar's widely publicized announcement in 1984 of a fast polynomial-time interior method for linear programming; in 1985, a formal connection was established between his method and classical barrier methods. Since then, interior methods have advanced so far, so fast, that their influence has transformed both the theory and practice of constrained optimization. This article provides a condensed, selective look at classical material and recent research about interior methods for nonlinearly constrained optimization.},

  abstract = {Synchronicity is a useful abstraction in many sensor network applications. Communication scheduling, coordinated duty cycling, and time synchronization can make use of a synchronicity primitive that achieves a tight alignment of individual nodes' firing phases. In this paper we present the Reachback Firefly Algorithm (RFA), a decentralized synchronicity algorithm implemented on TinyOS-based motes. Our algorithm is based on a mathematical model that describes how fireflies and neurons spontaneously synchronize. Previous work has assumed idealized nodes and not considered realistic effects of sensor network communication, such as message delays and loss. Our algorithm accounts for these effects by allowing nodes to use delayed information from the past to adjust the future firing phase. We present an evaluation of RFA that proceeds on three fronts. First, we prove the convergence of our algorithm in simple cases and predict the effect of parameter choices. Second, we leverage the TinyOS simulator to investigate the effects of varying parameter choice and network topology. Finally, we present results obtained on an indoor sensor network testbed demonstrating that our algorithm can synchronize sensor network devices to within 100 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}sec on a real multi-hop topology with links of varying quality.},

However, if the inherent recursive structure of the Bolza problem is properly exploited, the cost of computing a Newton step will increase only linearly withN. The efficient Newton implementation scheme proposed here is similar to Mayne's DDP (differential dynamic programming) method but produces the Newton step exactly, even when the dynamical equations are nonlinear. The proposed scheme is also related to a Riccati treatment of the linear, two-point boundary-value problems that characterize optimal solutions. For discrete-time problems, the dynamic programming approach and the Riccati substitution differ in an interesting way; however, these differences essentially vanish in the continuous-time limit.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for multiple autonomous helicopters in a complex environment. The NMPC provides a framework to solve optimal discrete control problems for a nonlinear system under state constraints and input saturation. Our approach combines stabilization of vehicle dynamics and decentralized trajectory generation, by including a potential function that reflects the state information of possibly moving obstacles or other vehicles to the cost function. We present various realistic scenarios which show that the integrated approach outperforms a hierarchical structure composed of a separate controller and a path planner based on the potential function method. The proposed approach is combined with an efficient numerical algorithm, which enables the real-time nonlinear model predictive control of multiple autonomous helicopters.},

The first procedure solves a quadratic programming problem at every time step and thus constructs the differential control law, and the other one uses the multiplier method to sum up all the point-wise constraints and then uses the unconstrained DDP approach to construct the differential control law. In the first approach, the constraints need to be explicitly dependent on the control variables when continuous-time model is used, whereas in the second approach, there is no such limitation. Therefore the second approach is more general than the first one. Detailed algorithms are given for numerical implementation. Numerical evaluation of the techniques is presented in Part 2 of the paper.},

Several efficient primaldual interior-Point methods for SOCP have been developed in the last few years. After reviewing the basic theory of SOCPs, we describe general families of Problems that tan be recast as SOCPs. These include robust linear programming and robust leastsquares Problems, Problems involving sums or maxima of norms, or with convex hyperbolic constraints. We discuss a variety of engineering applications, such as filter design, antenna array weight design, truss design, and grasping forte optimization in robotics.},

The rich mathematical literature on this subject greatly advances our ability to determine the presence of an essentially globally attracting fixed point-the formal ren dering of what we intuitively mean by a "correct" strat egy. The motivation for this work is the hope that it will facilitate the development of general design principles for "dynamically dexterous" robots.},

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

Two different methods to solve the discretized normal cone inclusions are compared: the projected over-relaxed Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iteration. The methods are evaluated for an electrically-driven quadrupedal robot in terms of robustness, accuracy, speed and ease of use. Furthermore, the dependence of the simulation speed on the choice of the generalized coordinates is examined. The proposed technique is implemented in C++ and compared to a fast and simple approach based on compliant contact models. In conclusion, the introduced method with hard contacts is very beneficial for the simulation of legged robots.},

This approach can be viewed as a direct nonlinear extension of MPC with linear models and is easily tailored to include stabilizing constraints. Using this framework we consider the application of three active set strategies as well as interior point methods applied to both the NMPC and the QP subproblem. The first two active set methods (QPOPT and and QKWIK) are general purpose solvers that have been incorporated into SQP algorithms previously, while the third is a Schur complement approach that can easily exploit the sparse structure of the KKT matrix in MPC.},

Bayesian optimization mploys the Bayesian technique of setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with evidence to get a posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of the next observation to make on the objective function, which must take into account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling areas likely to over improvement over the current best observation). We also present two detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization, with experiments|active user modelling with preferences, and hierarchical reinforcement learning and a discussion of the pros and cons of Bayesian optimization based on our experiences.},

  abstract = {Space robotics is considered one of the most promising approaches for on-orbit servicing (OOS) missions such as docking, berthing, refueling, repairing, upgrading, transporting, rescuing, and orbital debris removal. Many enabling techniques have been developed in the past two decades and several technology demonstration missions have been completed. A number of manned on-orbit servicing missions were successfully accomplished but unmanned, fully autonomous, servicing missions have not been done yet. Furthermore, all previous unmanned technology demonstration missions were designed to service cooperative targets only. Robotic servicing of a non-cooperative satellite is still an open research area facing many technical challenges. One of the greatest challenges is to ensure the servicing spacecraft safely and reliably docks with the target spacecraft or capture the target to stabilize it for subsequent servicing. This is especially important if the target has an unknown motion and kinematics/dynamics properties. Obviously, further research and development of the enabling technologies are needed. To motivate and facilitate such research and development, this paper provides a literature review of the recently developed technologies related to the kinematics, dynamics, control and verification of space robotic systems for manned and unmanned on-orbit servicing missions.},

We detail the updating rules for monitoring the different parameters (Lagrange multiplier estimate, quadratic penalty and log-barrier parameter), in order to get strong global convergence properties. We show that one advantage of this approach is that it introduces a natural regularization of the linear system to solve at each iteration, for the solution of a problem with a rank deficient Jacobian of constraints.

We establish global and fast local convergence under weak assumptions. In particular, we do not require the LICQ and our method is suitable for degenerate problems. Preliminary numerical experiments show that a factorization-based implementation of our method exhibits significant robustness while a factorization-free implementation, though not as robust, is promising. We briefly discuss generalizing our framework to other classes of methods and to problems with inequality constraints.},

  title = {A {{Novel Augmented Lagrangian Approach}} for {{Inequalities}} and {{Convergent Any}}-{{Time Non}}-{{Central Updates}}},
  abstract = {Motivated by robotic trajectory optimization problems we consider the Augmented Lagrangian approach to constrained optimization. We first propose an alternative augmentation of the Lagrangian to handle the inequality case (not based on slack variables) and a corresponding "central" update of the dual parameters. We proove certain properties of this update: roughly, in the case of LPs and when the "constraint activity" does not change between iterations, the KKT conditions hold after just one iteration. This gives essential insight on when the method is efficient in practise. We then present our main contribution, which are consistent any-time (non-central) updates of the dual parameters (i.e., updating the dual parameters when we are not currently at an extremum of the Lagrangian). Similar to the primal-dual Newton method, this leads to an algorithm that parallely updates the primal and dual solutions, not distinguishing between an outer loop to adapt the dual parameters and an inner loop to minimize the Lagrangian. We again proof certain properties of this anytime update: roughly, in the case of LPs and when constraint activities would not change, the dual solution converges after one iteration. Again, this gives essential insight in the caveats of the method: if constraint activities change the method may destablize. We propose simple smoothing, step-size adaptation and regularization mechanisms to counteract this effect and guarantee monotone convergence. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on random LPs as well as on standard robot trajectory optimization problems, confirming our motivation and intuition that our approach performs well if the problem structure implies moderate stability of constraint activity.},

  title = {Variational {{Contact}}-{{Implicit Trajectory Optimization}}},
  abstract = {Contact constraints arise naturally in many robot planning problems. In recent years, a variety of contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithms have been developed that avoid the pitfalls of mode pre-specification by simultaneously optimizing state, input, and contact force trajectories. However, their reliance on first-order integrators leads to a linear tradeoff between optimization problem size and plan accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a new family of trajectory optimization algorithms that leverage ideas from discrete variational mechanics to derive higher-order generalizations of the classic time-stepping method of Stewart and Trinkle. By using this dynamics formulation as constraints in a direct trajectory optimization scheme, it is possible to perform contact-implicit trajectory optimization with significantly improved accuracy compared to existing methods. For concreteness, we derive a second-order method and evaluate it using several simulated rigid body systems.},

Consequently, such research is often driven by time-consuming experimental methods. As an alternative, we present a framework for systematically modeling, planning, and controlling legged microrobots. We develop a threedimensional dynamic model of a 1.5 g quadrupedal microrobot with complexity (e.g., number of degrees of freedom) similar to larger-scale legged robots. We then adapt a recently developed variational contact-implicit trajectory optimization method to generate feasible whole-body locomotion plans for this microrobot, and we demonstrate that these plans can be tracked with simple joint-space controllers. We plan and execute periodic gaits at multiple stride frequencies and on various surfaces. These gaits achieve high per-cycle velocities, including a maximum of 10.87 mm/cycle, which is 15\% faster than previously measured velocities for this microrobot. Furthermore, we plan and execute a vertical jump of 9.96 mm, which is 78\% of the microrobot's center-of-mass height. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end demonstration of planning and tracking whole-body dynamic locomotion on a millimeter-scale legged microrobot.},

  abstract = {The Mars Science Laboratory entry capsule is used as an example to demonstrate how a blunt body of revolution must be treated as asymmetric in some respects when flying at a non-zero trim angle of attack. A brief description of the axisymmetric moment equations are provided before solving a system of equations describing the lateral-directional moment equations for a blunt body trimming at an angle of attack. Simplifying assumptions are made which allow the solution to the equations to be rearranged to relate the roll and yaw stability with sideslip angle to the frequency of oscillation of the vehicle body rates. The equations show that for a blunt body the roll and yaw rates are in phase and proportional to each other. The ratio of the rates is determined by the static stability coefficients and mass properties about those axes. A trajectory simulation is used to validate the static yaw stability parameter identification equation and a simple method of identifying the oscillation frequency from the body rates. The approach is shown to successfully extract the modeled yaw stability coefficient along a simulated Mars entry. Mars Science Laboratory flight data results are presented from earlier work which indicate that results from both the validation case and flight data are in agreement with preflight predictions. A brief discussion of the dynamic stability is also provided. Trimming at a nonzero angle suggests that the typical axisymmetric models of the dynamic stability coefficients should be modified. However, further experimental or computational work must be done to separate damping due to body rates and wind relative rates before the correct lifting formulation would affect simulation results.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns an acceleration method for fixed-point iterations that originated in work of D. G. Anderson [J. Assoc. Comput. Mach., 12 (1965), pp. 547\textendash{}560], which we accordingly call Anderson acceleration here. This method has enjoyed considerable success and wide usage in electronic structure computations, where it is known as Anderson mixing; however, it seems to have been untried or underexploited in many other important applications. Moreover, while other acceleration methods have been extensively studied by the mathematics and numerical analysis communities, this method has received relatively little attention from these communities over the years. A recent paper by H. Fang and Y. Saad [Numer. Linear Algebra Appl., 16 (2009), pp. 197\textendash{}221] has clarified a remarkable relationship of Anderson acceleration to quasi-Newton (secant updating) methods and extended it to define a broader Anderson family of acceleration methods. In this paper, our goals are to shed additional light on Anderson acceleration and to draw further attention to its usefulness as a general tool. We first show that, on linear problems, Anderson acceleration without truncation is ``essentially equivalent'' in a certain sense to the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method. We also show that the Type 1 variant in the Fang\textendash{}Saad Anderson family is similarly essentially equivalent to the Arnoldi (full orthogonalization) method. We then discuss practical considerations for implementing Anderson acceleration and illustrate its performance through numerical experiments involving a variety of applications.},

Through this scheme, the decomposed optimization can potentially be done more efficiently than the combined approach. Finally, we present a continuous-time constrained LQR algorithm which simultaneously optimizes the feedforward and feedback controller with O(n) time-complexity. In order to validate our approach, we show the performance of our framework on a quadrupedal robot. We choose the Center of Mass dynamics and the full kinematic formulation as the switched system model where the switching times as well as the contact forces and the joint velocities are optimized for different locomotion tasks such as gap crossing, walking and trotting.},

  abstract = {We propose a method to estimate the region of attraction of a nonlinear ODE based only on measurements of the trajectory - implying that the nonlinear vector field need not be known a priori. This method is based on using trajectory data to determine values of a form of converse Lyapunov function at a finite number of point in the state-space. Least absolute deviations is then used to fit this data to a Sumof-Squares polynomial whose level sets then become estimates for the region of attraction. This learned Lyapunov function can then be used to predict whether newly generated initial conditions lie in the region of attraction. Extensive numerical testing is used to show that the method correctly predicts whether a new initial condition is within the region of attraction of the nonlinear ODE on over 95\% of a generated set of test data.},

Like its predecessor, the Cheetah 3 exploits tailored mechanical design to enable simple control strategies for dynamic locomotion and features highbandwidth proprioceptive actuators to manage physical interaction with the environment. A new leg design is presented that includes proprioceptive actuation on the abduction/adduction degrees of freedom in addition to an expanded range of motion on the hips and knees. To make full use of these new capabilities, general balance and locomotion controllers for Cheetah 3 are presented. These controllers are embedded into a modular control architecture that allows the robot to handle unexpected terrain disturbances through reactive gait modification and without the need for external sensors or prior environment knowledge. The efficiency of the robot is demonstrated by a low Cost of Transport (CoT) over multiple gaits at moderate speeds, with the lowest CoT of 0.45 found during trotting. Experiments showcase the ability to blindly climb up stairs as a result of the full system integration. These results collectively represent a promising step toward a platform capable of generalized dynamic legged locomotion.},

  shorttitle = {Effects of Changes in Plantar Sensory Feedback on Human Gait Characteristics},
  doi = {10.1080/19424280.2011.653990},
  abstract = {Background: Deficits in motor control can be observed with a decrease in plantar sensation. There is evidence that changing the plantar feedback leads to kinematic, kinetic and neuromuscular adaptations in static as well as dynamic conditions. The effect of changes in plantar feedback on the modulation of gait has not been clarified conclusively.
Objectives: The purpose of this paper was to provide a review of studies reporting the effects of changes in plantar feedback on human gait characteristics.
Method: The databases Medline (PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) were searched for clinical (CTs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning foot sensation and gait.
Results: Twenty-three studies were included in the evaluation. Several methods were used to affect the sensitivity of the foot sole. After cooling or sedating the foot sole, predominant changes occur in decreased peak pressures, muscle activities and joint angles, and relocation of the centre of pressure under the foot was found. Walking on uneven surfaces results in a decrease in gait velocity, cadence and step length and also an increase in step variability. The use of textured insoles during walking leads to increased knee, hip and ankle angles, forces and moments in neurological patients with decreased foot sensation. In particular, individuals with sensory deficits show significant gait improvements when using textured or vibrating insoles.
Conclusions: Changes in plantar feedback lead to stimulation-specific adaptations of gait characteristics. Further prospective RCTs should be performed to investigate interventions for enhancing plantar receptor feedback for the prevention of falls and the treatment of injuries and movement disorders.},

  abstract = {This study employed manipulation of sensory inputs (vision and plantar-surface cutaneous sensation) during gait termination to elicit insight into the roles played by these sensory systems in the control of gait termination. Attenuation of cutaneous sensation was achieved through hypothermic anesthesia. Visual information was occluded using special glasses. The subjects were asked to walk along an 8 m walkway and during randomly selected trials (25\% of trials) to terminate their gait in a predetermined area. The centre of mass (COM) was obtained in order to provide an indication of the efficiency and stability during termination when sensory inputs were manipulated. Lack of visual information delayed the initiation of the slowing down of the COM forward progression and increased the step length of the last step of termination. Additionally, lack of vision resulted in the COM moving closer to the base of support (BOS) during double support and more variability, in the COM, when attempting to achieve a final stable position. Insensitivity of the plantar-surface mechanoreceptors led to a longer second step and a more variable foot placement of the first step, and increased the loading rate during the final two steps of termination. Additionally when vision and cutaneous information were absent the resolution of the final stable position was not as effectively controlled. The results demonstrated that visual information about self-motion and object-motion and sensation from the plantar surface of the foot play phase-specific roles in the control of COM during gait termination. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  title = {The Effect of Changes in Foot Sensation on Plantar Pressure and Muscle Activity},
  abstract = {Objective. Purpose was (a) to quantify changes that occur in plantar pressure following attenuation of sensory input from the plantar surface of the foot, and (b) to quantify the resultant changes in motor output as measured by the changes of muscular activation. Design. Cross-sectional design in a laboratory setting.
Background. The importance of aerent feedback to controlling gait has been demonstrated in quasi-static situations, and with animal models. However, the eects and functional signi\textregistered{}cance of sensory feedback from cutaneous receptors in the plantar surface of the foot during walking are still not resolved.
Methods. Sensory thresholds were determined for the plantar surface of the foot. Sensory feedback was reduced with an ice intervention. Three altered sensory states were tested: whole foot, forefoot and rearfoot ice exposure. Plantar pressure distributions and lower extremity muscle patterns were collected while walking before and after ice exposure.
Results. Exposure to ice increased vibration thresholds to low and high frequency vibrations. Peak pressure and pressure{$\pm$}time integral were signi\textregistered{}cantly higher in areas of normal sensitivity and lower at the insensate areas. The center of pressure underfoot shifted away from areas of decreased sensitivity when sensory input is reduced from a portion of the foot. Muscle patterns were signi\textregistered{}cantly altered when sensory feedback was changed.
Conclusions. By altering sensory feedback, one can alter gait kinetics and muscular activation patterns. Cutaneous feedback is important in the regulation and modi\textregistered{}cation of gait patterns, and sensory input needs to be included in any model that attempts to predict motion.},

  abstract = {Reduced plantar sensation secondary to chronic diffuse polyneuropathy (PN) is believed to reduce locomotor stability, especially when walking at non-preferred speeds. However, the contribution of plantar sensation to the maintenance of locomotor stability is not entirely clear. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of acute loss of plantar sensation on the stability-related kinematic properties of walking at different speeds. Lower-extremity joint kinematics were acquired as healthy young adults walked on a treadmill at their preferred walking speed (PWS) and three predetermined speeds (0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 m/s) under both normal and desensitized conditions. Desensitization of the foot soles was induced by ice-exposure, and plantar pressure sensation was assessed by a 5.07 monofilament. The average magnitude of stride duration variability (SDvar) and lower-extremity joint angle variability (JTvar), as well as shortand long-term ``finite-time'' Lyapunov exponents (kS\~AT, k\~ALT) associated with lower-extremity joint angles were computed. Ice-induced plantar desensitization led to increased kS\~AT (\$40\%) and k\~ALT (\$8\%) values but did not affect SDvar or JTvar. Higher treadmill speed led to greater k\~AST and k\~ALT values, but the speed effects were not influenced by plantar desensitization.While acute loss of plantar sensation does not appear to influence the magnitude of spatial or temporal variability, it did attenuate the state-space trajectory divergence caused by stride-to-stride variability (i.e., kS\~AT and kL\~A T). However, as opposed to walking at PWS, otherwise healthy locomotor systems do not appear to place increased reliance on plantar sensation when walking at non-preferred treadmill speeds.},

  title = {Odometry {{Based}} on {{Auto}}-{{Calibrating Inertial Measurement Unit Attached}} to the {{Feet}}},
  abstract = {Location of pedestrian in indoor environment remains an open problem. A cheap and reliable sensor in this context is the inertial measurement units (IMU), carried by the pedestrian while he/she is walking. However, due to the bias of both the accelerometer and the gyroscope, integrating directly the inertial measurements leads to tremendous drift, as the state of the system (position, orientation, velocity, bias) is not fully observable. In this paper, we consider the specific case where an IMU is attached to one of the pedestrian's feet. We exploit specific prior knowledges (i.e. the fact that the foot lands at zero velocity on a horizontal plane) in order to make the full state of the IMU observable. The inertial measurements and these prior knowledges are gathered in a graphical model (a factor graph), and are exploited to build a maximum-likelihood estimator. The technical difficulty is to handle the size of the graph such that it is tractable in a limited time window, that we do by relying on the pre-integration technique. In that existing framework, our contributions are to reformulate the pre-integration method using quaternions while giving a simpler algebraic formulation, and to apply this method for estimating the human foot-pose during walking. We validate these concepts on several long-range trajectories capture with human subject and compare the results with ground-truth measurements (coming from a motion capture system) and previous results of the state of the art.},

Measuring shear forces is useful for grasping and manipulating objects; however, there are limited effective shear sensing strategies that are compatible with existing end effectors. Here, we report a bioinspired and flexible, resistive microfluidic shear force sensor skin. The sensor skin is wrapped around a finger-shaped end effector and fixed at the location of the nail bed. When the skin is subjected to shear force, one side of the skin experiences tension while the other side experiences compression and bulges similar to a human fingerpad. The tension and compression are measured by liquid metal strain gauges, embedded in PDMS, that are strategically placed adjacent to the nail bed, away from regions of direct finger-object contact. We present the sensor design, a finite element analysis static mechanical characterization model, as well as static response experiments. The resistive shear sensing skin exhibits greater than 10-bit dynamic range (up to 5 N) that is insensitive to the applied normal force. The resistive shear sensing skin is intrinsically flexible and immune to fatigue and other problems of solid-state sensors when subjected to repeated, large strains.},

Various parameters that affect collision severity, including interface friction, interface stiffness, end tip velocity and joint stiffness irrespective of controller bandwidth are also explored using the sensor to provide information about the contact force at the site of impact. Joint stiffness is made independent of controller bandwidth limitations using passive torsional springs of various stiffnesses.

Herein, we present an all-solution processable pressure insensitive strain sensor that utilizes the difference in structural change upon the application of pressure and tensile strain. Under the application of strain, microcracks occur within the multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) network, inducing a large change in resistance with gauge factor of {$\sim$}56 at 70\% strain. On the other hand, under the application of pressure to as high as 140 kPa, negligible change in resistance is observed, which can be attributed to the pressure working primarily to close the pores, and hence minimally changing the MWCNT network conformation. Our sensor can easily be coated onto irregularly shaped three-dimensional objects (e.g., robotic hand) via spray coating, or be attached to human joints, to detect bending motion. Furthermore, our sensor can differentiate between shear stress and normal pressure, and the local strain can be spatially mapped without the use of patterned electrode array using electrical impedance tomography. These demonstrations make our sensor highly useful and important for the future development of high performance tactile sensors.},

The crucial technological barrier is to package force sensor and communication function in a small volume. In this paper, we propose the novel device structure based on a wafer bonding technology to integrate and package capacitive force sensor using silicon diaphragm and an integrated circuit separately manufactured. Unique fabrication processes are developed, such as the feed-through forming using a dicing process, a planarization of the Benzocyclobutene (BCB) polymer filled in the feed-through and a wafer bonding to stack silicon diaphragm onto ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) wafer. The ASIC used in this paper has a capacitance measurement circuit and a digital communication interface mimicking a tactile receptor of a human. We successfully integrated the force sensor and the ASIC into a 2.5\texttimes{}2.5\texttimes{}0.3 mm die and confirmed autonomously transmitted packets which contain digital sensing data with the linear force sensitivity of 57,640 Hz/N and 10 mN of data fluctuation. A small stray capacitance of 1.33 pF is achieved by use of 10 {$\mu$}m thick BCB isolation layer and this minimum package structure.},

  abstract = {We consider global convergence properties of the augmented Lagrangian methods on problems with degenerate constraints, with a special emphasis on mathematical programs with complementarity constraints (MPCC). In the general case, we show convergence to stationary points of the problem under an error bound condition for the feasible set (which is weaker than constraint qualifications), assuming that the iterates have some modest features of approximate local minimizers of the augmented Lagrangian. For MPCC, we first argue that even weak forms of general constraint qualifications that are suitable for convergence of the augmented Lagrangian methods, such as the recently proposed relaxed positive linear dependence condition, should not be expected to hold and thus special analysis is needed. We next obtain a rather complete picture, showing that, under this context's usual MPCC-linear independence constraint qualification, feasible accumulation points of the iterates are guaranteed to be C-stationary for MPCC (better than weakly stationary), but in general need not be M-stationary (hence, neither strongly stationary). However, strong stationarity is guaranteed if the generated dual sequence is bounded, which we show to be the typical numerical behavior even though the multiplier set itself is unbounded. Experiments with the ALGENCAN augmented Lagrangian solver on the MacMPEC and DEGEN collections are reported, with comparisons to the SNOPT and filterSQP implementations of the SQP method, to the MINOS implementation of the linearly constrained Lagrangian method, and to the interior-point solvers IPOPT and KNITRO. We show that ALGENCAN is a very good option if one is primarily interested in robustness and quality of computed solutions.},

  abstract = {Differential dynamic programming (DDP) is a widely used trajectory optimization technique that addresses nonlinear optimal control problems, and can readily handle nonlinear cost functions. However, it does not handle either state or control constraints. This paper presents a novel formulation of DDP that is able to accommodate arbitrary nonlinear inequality constraints on both state and control. The main insight in standard DDP is that a quadratic approximation of the value function can be derived using a recursive backward pass, however the recursive formulae are only valid for unconstrained problems. The main technical contribution of the presented method is a derivation of the recursive quadratic approximation formula in the presence of nonlinear constraints, after a set of active constraints has been identified at each point in time. This formula is used in a new Constrained-DDP (CDDP) algorithm that iteratively determines these active set and is guaranteed to converge toward a local minimum. CDDP is demonstrated on several underactuated optimal control problems up to 12D with obstacle avoidance and control constraints and is shown to outperform other methods for accommodating constraints.},

  abstract = {Because chip-scale spacecraft could be deployed in large numbers at low cost, they could be used to collect data on a large portion of an atmosphere even if some fraction of the spacecraft do not succeed. When entering a planetary or lunar atmosphere, a satellite with a high ratio of surface area to mass tends to decelerate at higher altitudes and thus incur less aerodynamic heating. This is the effect of a well-known parameter called the ballistic coefficient. For extremely low values of ballistic coefficient, it may be possible to enter an atmosphere without an extensive thermal protection system. In this paper we discuss chip-scale spacecraft and simulate them entering all of the significant atmospheres of the solar system: Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn's moon Titan. A chip-scale satellite could provide sought-after data for planetary atmospheres, especially the tenuous upper atmospheres that are difficult to study using radio occultation. This study introduces a low-cost architecture to obtain useful scientific data about upper atmospheres and reentry itself. Practical challenges associated with the design concept are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The discovery of the exoplanet Proxima b highlights the potential for the coming generation of giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs) to characterize terrestrial --- potentially habitable --- planets orbiting nearby stars with direct imaging. This will require continued development and implementation of optimized adaptive optics systems feeding coronagraphs on the GSMTs. Such development should proceed with an understanding of the fundamental limits imposed by atmospheric turbulence. Here we seek to address this question with a semi-analytic framework for calculating the post-coronagraph contrast in a closed-loop AO system. We do this starting with the temporal power spectra of the Fourier basis calculated assuming frozen flow turbulence, and then apply closed-loop transfer functions. We include the benefits of a simple predictive controller, which we show could provide over a factor of 1400 gain in raw PSF contrast at 1 \$\textbackslash{}lambda/D\$ on bright stars, and more than a factor of 30 gain on an I = 7.5 mag star such as Proxima. More sophisticated predictive control can be expected to improve this even further. Assuming a photon noise limited observing technique such as High Dispersion Coronagraphy, these gains in raw contrast will decrease integration times by the same large factors. Predictive control of atmospheric turbulence should therefore be seen as one of the key technologies which will enable ground-based telescopes to characterize terrrestrial planets.},

The goal of ASTERIA is to achieve arcsecond-level line-of-sight pointing error and highly stable focal plane temperature control. These capabilities enable precision photometry\textemdash{}i.e. the careful measurement of stellar brightness over time\textemdash{}which in turn allows investigation of astrophysical phenomena such as transiting exoplanets. By the end of the 90-day prime mission, ASTERIA had achieved line-of-sight pointing stability of approximately 0.5 arcseconds root mean square (RMS) over 20-minute observations, pointing repeatability of 1 milliarcsecond RMS from one observation to the next, and focal plane temperature stability better than {$\pm$}0.01 K over 20-minute observations. This paper presents an overview of the ASTERIA flight and ground system, summarizes the pre-delivery test campaign, and discusses the on-orbit performance obtained by the pointing and thermal control subsystems. We also describe the process for planning opportunistic science observations and present lessons learned from development and operations. Having successfully operated for over 200 days as of this writing, ASTERIA is currently in an extended mission to observe nearby bright stars for transiting exoplanets.},

This is a well-known challenging problem in optimal control theory for which closed-form solutions exist only for a few systems of small dimensions. This paper presents a very generic solution to the minimum-time problem for arbitrary discrete-time linear systems. It is a numerical solution based on sparse optimization, that is the minimization of the number of nonzero elements in the state sequence over a fixed control horizon. We consider both single input and multiple inputs systems. An important observation is that, contrary to the continuous-time case, the minimum-time control for discrete-time systems is not necessarily entirely bang-bang.},

  abstract = {Executing agile quadrotor maneuvers with cablesuspended payloads is a challenging problem and complications induced by the dynamics typically require trajectory optimization. State-of-the-art approaches often need significant computation time and complex parameter tuning. We present a novel dynamical model and a fast trajectory optimization algorithm for quadrotors with a cable-suspended payload. Our first contribution is a new formulation of the suspended payload behavior, modeled as a link attached to the quadrotor with a combination of two revolute joints and a prismatic joint, all being passive. Differently from state of the art, we do not require the use of hybrid modes depending on the cable tension. Our second contribution is a fast trajectory optimization technique for the aforementioned system. Our model enables us to pose the trajectory optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). Desired behaviors of the system (e.g., obstacle avoidance) can easily be formulated within this framework. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of computation speed and guarantees feasibility of the trajectory with respect to both the system dynamics and control input saturation, while utilizing far fewer tuning parameters. We experimentally validate our approach on a real quadrotor showing that our method generalizes to a variety of tasks, such as flying through desired waypoints while avoiding obstacles, or throwing the payload toward a desired target. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that three-dimensional, agile maneuvers exploiting the system dynamics have been achieved on quadrotors with a cable-suspended payload.},

A high-level sampling-based planning framework, in tandem with a low-level inverse contact dynamics solver, effectively explores the space of continuous pushes with discrete pusher contact switch-overs. We model the frictional interaction between gripper, grasped object, and pusher, by discretizing complex surface/line contacts into arrays of hard frictional point contacts. The inverse dynamics problem of finding an instantaneous pusher motion that yields a desired instantaneous object motion takes the form of a mixed nonlinear complementarity problem. Building upon this dynamics solver, our planner generates a sequence of pushes that steers the object to a goal grasp. We evaluate the performance of the planner for the case of a parallel-jaw gripper manipulating different objects, both in simulation and with real experiments. Through these examples, we highlight the important properties of the planner: respecting and exploiting the hybrid dynamics of contact sticking/sliding/rolling and a sense of efficiency with respect to discrete contact switch-overs.},

  abstract = {Parallelism can be used to significantly increase the throughput of computationally expensive algorithms. With the widespread adoption of parallel computing platforms such as GPUs, it is natural to consider whether these architectures can benefit robotics researchers interested in solving trajectory optimization problems online. Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithms have been shown to achieve some of the best timing performance in robotics tasks by making use of optimized dynamics methods and CPU multi-threading. This paper aims to analyze the benefits and tradeoffs of higher degrees of parallelization using a multiple-shooting variant of DDP implemented on a GPU. We describe our implementation strategy and present results demonstrating its performance compared to an equivalent multi-threaded CPU implementation using several benchmark control tasks. Our results suggest that GPU-based solvers can offer speedups over parallelized CPU implementations and that tradeoffs exist between convergence behavior and degree of parallelism.},

This controller is capable of walking on rough terrain, and it also achieves long footsteps, fast walking speeds, and heel-strike and toe-off in simulation. During development of these and other whole body tasks on the physical robot, we introduced an additional optimization component in the low-level controller, namely an inverse kinematics controller. Modeling and torque measurement errors and hardware features of the Atlas robot led us to this three-part approach, which was applied to three tasks in the DRC Trials in December 2013.},

The DRC Trials consisted of eight different challenges that tested robot mobility, manipulation, and control under degraded communications and time constraints. Team IHMC competed using the Atlas humanoid robot made by Boston Dynamics. We competed against 16 international teams and placed second in the competition. This article discusses the challenges we faced in transitioning from simulation to hardware. It also discusses the lessons learned both during the competition and in the months of preparation leading up to it. The lessons address the value of reliable hardware and solid software practices. They also cover effective approaches to bipedal walking and designing for human-robot teamwork.

  abstract = {Designing and controlling an anthropomorphic mechatronic system that is able to perform a dynamic running motion is a challenging task. One difficulty is that the fundamental principles of natural human running motions are not yet fully understood. The purpose of this paper is to show that mathematical optimization is a helpful tool to gain this insight into fast and complex motions. We present physics-based running motions for complex models of human-like running in three dimensions that have been generated by optimization. Running is modeled as a multiphase periodic motion with discontinuities, based on multibody system models of the locomotor system with actuators and spring-damper elements at each joint. The problem of generating gaits is formulated as offline optimal control problem and solved by an efficient direct multiple shooting method. We present optimization results using energy-related criteria and show that they have a close resemblance to running motions of humans. The results provide information about the internal forces and torques required to produce natural human running, as well as on the resulting kinematics.},

  abstract = {This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples},

How did initial perceptions of CubeSats evolve to this state? Are CubeSats toys, tools, or merely another source of orbital debris? With so many CubeSats now in orbit, it is now possible to make a data-based assessment of these missions. Using data collected from a variety of sources, this study evaluates the on-orbit performance of CubeSats. The history of CubeSat missions is reviewed, with the missions classified according to size, origin, mission life, and on-orbit performance. It is shown that several correctable design/implementation errors plague the university side of CubeSat missions, and that the P-POD launch container, not the CubeSat specification, is the true enabling technology for this class of mission.},

These questions are among those highlighted in the current Solar Decadal Servey, e.g., ``Discover and characterize fundamental processes that occur both within the heliosphere and throughout the Universe.'' Furthermore, CME radio emission is quite strong, such that only a relatively small number of antennas is required, and a small mission would make a fundamental advancement in our scientific understanding. Indeed, the current state-of-the-art for tracking CME radio emission is defined by single antennas (Wind/WAVES, Stereo/SWAVES) in which the tracking is accomplished by assuming a frequency-to-density mapping.},

The constellation is in a Lissajous or Halo orbit around the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point (L2), in a passive formation flying mode. The Daughters' three dipole antennas detect low frequency radio waves and transmit the digitized data to the Mothership, where data correlation and digital signal processing are done to reduce the data volume for transmission back to the Earth. This paper presents a concept design of the satellite systems for such a space radio telescope array, using the recent micro- and Nanosatellite technologies and products. A preliminary concept design is presented for the 13 satellites involved in this mission, with brief discussion on the subsystems and technologies involved. Technical issues and potential solutions are discussed and further elaborated for the key technologies that enable such a complex science mission with links to the recent satellite engineering experiences.},

The generated tree serves as a lookup table control policy to get any reachable initial condition within that region to the goal. The approach combines motion planning with reasoning about the set of states around a trajectory for which the feedback policy of the trajectory is able to stabilize the system. The key idea is to use a random sample from the bounded region for both motion planning and approximation of the stabilizable sets by falsification; this keeps the number of samples and simulations needed to generate covering policies reasonably low. We simulate the nonlinear system to falsify the stabilizable sets, which allows enforcing input and state constraints. Compared to the algebraic verification using sums of squares optimization in our previous work, the simulationbased approximation of the stabilizable set is less exact, but considerably easier to implement and can be applied to a broader range of nonlinear systems. We show simulation results obtained with model systems and study the performance and robustness of the generated policies.},

Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.},

  doi = {10.1109/ACC.2014.6859404},
  abstract = {This paper introduces the novel concept of LQR smoothing, which analogous to Kalman smoothing consists of both a backward pass and a forward pass. In the backward pass the cost-to-go function is computed using the standard LQR Riccati equation that runs backward in time, and in the forward pass the cost-to-come function is computed using a Riccati equation that runs forward in time. The sum of the cost-to-go and the cost-to-come function gives the total-cost function, and we will show that the states for which the total-cost function is minimal constitute the minimum-cost trajectory for the linear-quadratic optimal control problem. This insight is used to construct a fast-converging iterative procedure to compute a locally-optimal feedback control policy for systems with non-linear dynamics and non-quadratic cost, where in each iteration the current minimal-total-cost states provide natural points about which the dynamics can be linearized and the cost quadratized. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on two illustrative non-linear control problems involving physical differential-drive robots and simulated quadrotor helicopters in environments with obstacles, and show that our approach converges in only about a third of the number of iterations required by existing approaches such as Iterative LQR.},

  abstract = {For motion planning and veri cation, as well as for model-based control, it is important to have an accurate dynamic system model. In many cases, friction is a signi cant component of the model. When considering the solution of the rigid-body forward dynamics problem in systems such as robots, we can often appeal to the fundamental theorem of di erential equations to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. It is known, however, that when Coulomb friction is added to the dynamic equations, the forward dynamic solution may not exist and if it exists, it is not necessarily unique. In these situations, the inverse dynamic problem is ill-posed as well. Thus there is the need to understand the nature of the existence and uniqueness problems and to know under what conditions these problems arise. In this paper, we show that even single degree of freedom systems can exhibit existence and uniqueness problems. Next, we introduce compliance in the otherwise rigid-body model. This has two e ects. First, the forward and inverse problems become well-posed. Thus we are guaranteed unique solutions. Secondly, we show that the extra dynamic solutions associated with the rigid model are unstable.},

The coming years will see the emergence of location-aware networks with submeter accuracy, relying on accurate range measurements provided by wide bandwidth transmissions. In this twopart paper, we determine the fundamental limits of localization accuracy of wideband wireless networks in harsh multipath environments. We first develop a general framework to characterize the localization accuracy of a given node here and then extend our analysis to cooperative location-aware networks in Part II. In this paper, we characterize localization accuracy in terms of a performance measure called the squared position error bound (SPEB), and introduce the notion of equivalent Fisher information (EFI) to derive the SPEB in a succinct expression. This methodology provides insights into the essence of the localization problem by unifying localization information from individual anchors and that from a priori knowledge of the agent's position in a canonical form. Our analysis begins with the received waveforms themselves rather than utilizing only the signal metrics extracted from these waveforms, such as time-of-arrival and received signal strength. Hence, our framework exploits all the information inherent in the received waveforms, and the resulting SPEB serves as a fundamental limit of localization accuracy.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of a control-Lyapunov policy, with quadratic Lyapunov function, requires the solution of a quadratic program (QP) at each time step. For small problems this QP can be solved explicitly; for larger problems an on-line optimization method can be used. For this reason the control-Lyapunov control policy is considered a computationally intensive control law, as opposed to an `analytical' control law, such as conventional linear state feedback, LQG, or H-infinity, too complex or slow to be used in high speed control applications. In this note we show that by pre-computing certain quantities, the control-Lyapunov policy can be evaluated extremely efficiently. We will show that when the number of inputs is on the order of the square-root of the state dimension, the cost of evaluating a control-Lyapunov policy is on the same order as the cost of evaluating a simple linear state feedback policy, and less (in order) than the cost of updating a Kalman filter state estimate. To give an idea of the speeds involved, for a problem with 100 states and 10 inputs, the control-Lyapunov policy can be evaluated in around 67us, on a 2GHz AMD processor; the same processor requires 44us to carry out a Kalman filter update.},

  doi = {10.1109/TAC.1968.1099026},
  abstract = {Differential dynamic programming is a technique, based on dynamic programming rather than the calculus of variations, for determining the optimal control function of a nonlinear system. Unlike conventional dynamic programming where the optimal cost function is considered globally, differential dynamic programming applies the principle of optimality in the neighborhood of a nominal, possibly nonoptimal, trajectory. This allows the coefficients of a linear or quadratic expansion of the cost function to be computed in reverse time along the trajectory: these coefficients may then be used to yield a new improved trajectory (i.e., the algorithms are of the "successive sweep" type). A class of nonlinear control problems, linear in the control variables, is studied using differential dynamic programming. It is shown that for the free-end-point problem, the first partial derivatives of the optimal cost function are continuous throughout the state space, and the second partial derivatives experience jumps at switch points of the control function. A control problem that has an aualytic solution is used to illustrate these points. The fixed-end-point problem is converted into an equivalent free-end-point problem by adjoining the end-point constraints to the cost functional using Lagrange multipliers: a useful interpretation for Pontryagin's adjoint variables for this type of problem emerges from this treatment. The above results are used to devise new second- and first-order algorithms for determining the optimal bang-bang control by successively improving a nominal guessed control function. The usefulness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated by the computation of a number of control problem examples.},

An efficient O(n) recursive algorithm for forward dynamics is also extracted from the inverse factorization.

The key observation that makes rigid body control amenable to an efficient (convex) design technique such as SOS is that both quaternions and modified Rodriguez parameters enable the representation of the attitude dynamics of a rigid body by polynomial vector fields. The model proposed in this paper will use MRP instead of quaternions to represent the rigid body attitude to yield a minimal parameterization. The effectiveness of the proposed control technique is shown in simulations for a large angle maneuver corresponding to a satellite rotation about a fixed axis.},

  abstract = {In this work, variational integrators of higher order for dynamical systems with holonomic constraints are constructed and analyzed. The construction is based on approximating the configuration and the Lagrange multiplier via different polynomials. The splitting of the augmented Lagrangian in two parts enables the use of different quadrature formulas to approximate the integral of each part. Conditions are derived that ensure the linear independence of the higher order constrained discrete EulerLagrange equations and stiff accuracy. Time reversibility is investigated for the discrete flow on configuration level only as for the flow on configuration and momentum level. The fulfillment of the hidden constraints plays an important role for the time reversibility of the presented integrators. The order of convergence is investigated numerically. Order reduction of the momentum and the Lagrange multiplier compared to the order of the configuration occurs in general, but can be avoided by fulfilling the hidden constraints in a simple post processing step. Regarding efficiency versus accuracy a numerical analysis yields that higher orders increase the accuracy of the discrete solution substantially while the computational costs decrease. A comparison to the constrained Galerkin methods in Marsden and West (Acta Numerica 10, 357\textendash{}514 2001) and the symplectic SPARK integrators of Jay (SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis 45(5), 1814\textendash{}1842 2007) reveals that the approach presented here is more general and thus allows for more flexibility in the design of the integrator.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider linear programming (LP) and second order cone programming (SOCP) based alternatives to sum of squares (SOS) programming and apply this framework to high-dimensional problems arising in control applications. Despite the wide acceptance of SOS programming in the control and optimization communities, scalability has been a key challenge due to its reliance on semidefinite programming (SDP) as its main computational engine. While SDPs have many appealing features, current SDP solvers do not approach the scalability or numerical maturity of LP and SOCP solvers. Our approach is based on the recent work of Ahmadi and Majumdar [1], which replaces the positive semidefiniteness constraint inherent in the SOS approach with stronger conditions based on diagonal dominance and scaled diagonal dominance. This leads to the DSOS and SDSOS cones of polynomials, which can be optimized over using LP and SOCP respectively. We demonstrate this approach on four high dimensional control problems that are currently well beyond the reach of SOS programming: computing a region of attraction for a 22 dimensional system, analysis of a 50 node network of oscillators, searching for degree 3 controllers and degree 8 Lyapunov functions for an Acrobot system (with the resulting controller validated on a hardware platform), and a balancing controller for a 30 state and 14 control input model of the ATLAS humanoid robot. While there is additional conservatism introduced by our approach, extensive numerical experiments on smaller instances of our problems demonstrate that this conservatism can be small compared to SOS programming.},

  abstract = {The dramatic increase in computational power since the Apollo program has enabled the development of numerical predictor-corrector (NPC) entry guidance algorithms that allow on-board accurate determination of a vehicle's trajectory. These algorithms are sufficiently mature to be flown. They are highly adaptive, especially in the face of extreme dispersion and off-nominal situations compared with reference-trajectory following algorithms. The performance and reliability of entry guidance are critical to mission success. This paper compares the performance of a recently developed fully numerical predictor-corrector entry guidance (FNPEG) algorithm with that of the Apollo skip entry guidance. Through extensive dispersion testing, it is clearly demonstrated that the Apollo skip entry guidance algorithm would be inadequate in meeting the landing precision requirement for missions with medium (4000-7000 km) and long ({$>$}7000 km) downrange capability requirements under moderate dispersions chiefly due to poor modeling of atmospheric drag. In the presence of large dispersions, a significant number of failures occur even for short-range missions due to the deviation from planned reference trajectories. The FNPEG algorithm, on the other hand, is able to ensure high landing precision in all cases tested. All factors considered, a strong case is made for adopting fully numerical algorithms for future skip entry missions.},

We selected a basketball as a spherical tire, because basketball is made of rubber. In general, rubber tire has three features, which are durability, adaptabilities to the ground surface and force transmissivity. We think that using a basketball as a spherical tire is low-cost and advantageous. Next, we describe how to calculate torque and angular velocity, which motors generate to roll a basketball. They are needed for driving motors and dynamic simulations. Finally, we propose an interface to operate the vehicle. One, who rides on the vehicle, can move to all directions by shifting one's center of mass. A six-axis force-torque sensor senses weight shift},

  doi = {10.1006/jtbi.2001.2387},
  abstract = {Stability is as essential to flying as lift itself, but previous discussions of how flying animals maintain stability have been limited in both number and scope. By developing the pitching moment equations for gliding animals and by discussing potential sources of roll and yaw stability, we consider the various sources of static stability used by gliding animals. We find that gliding animals differ markedly from aircraft in how they maintain stability. In particular, the pendulum stability provided when the centre of gravity lies below the wings is a much more important source of stability in flying animals than in most conventional aircraft. Drag-based stability also appears to be important for many gliding animals, whereas in aircraft, drag is usually kept to a minimum. One unexpected consequence of these differences is that the golden measure of static pitching stability in aircraft\textemdash{}the static margin\textemdash{}can only strictly be applied to flying animals if the equilibrium angle of attack is specified. We also derive several rules of thumb by which stable fliers can be identified. Stable fliers are expected to exhibit one or more of the following features: (1) Wings that are swept forward in slow flight. (2) Wings that are twisted down at the tips when swept back (wash-out) and twisted up at the tips when swept forwards (wash-in). (3) Additional lifting surfaces (canard, hindwings or a tail) inclined nose-up to the main wing if they lie forward of it, and nose-down if they lie behind it (longitudinal dihedral). Each of these predictions is directional\textemdash{}the opposite is expected to apply in unstable animals. In addition, animals with reduced stability are expected to display direct flight patterns in turbulent conditions, in contrast to the erratic flight patterns predicted for stable animals, in which large restoring forces are generated. Using these predictions, we find that flying animals possess a far higher degree of inherent stability than has generally been recognized. This conclusion is reinforced by measurements of the relative positions of the centres of gravity and lift in birds, which suggest that the wings alone may be sufficient to provide longitudinal static stability. Birds may therefore resemble tailless aircraft more closely than conventional aircraft with a tailplane.},

  title = {A {{Phase}}-{{Reconstruction Technique}} for {{Low}}-{{Power Centimeter}}-{{Accurate Mobile Positioning}}},
  abstract = {A carrier phase reconstruction technique is presented as an enabler for low-power centimeter-accurate mobile positioning. Reliable carrier phase reconstruction permits the duty cycling of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver whose outputs are used for precise carrier-phase differential GNSS (CDGNSS) positioning. Existing CDGNSS techniques are power intensive because they require continuous tracking of each GNSS signal's carrier phase. By contrast, the less-precise code-ranging technique that is commonly used in mobile devices for 3-to-10-meter-accurate positioning allows for aggressive measurement duty-cycling, which enables low-power implementations. The technique proposed in this paper relaxes the CDGNSS continuous phase tracking requirement by solving a mixed real and integer estimation problem to reconstruct a continuous carrier phase time history from intermittent phase measurement intervals each having an ambiguous initial phase. Theoretical bounds on the probability of successful phase reconstruction, corroborated by Monte-Carlo-type simulation, are used to investigate the sensitivity of the proposed technique to various system parameters, including the time period between successive phase measurement intervals, the duration of each interval, the carrier-to-noise ratio, and the line-of-sight acceleration uncertainty. A demonstration on real data indicates that coupling a GNSS receiver with a consumer-grade inertial measurement unit enables reliable phase reconstruction with phase measurement duty cycles as low as 5\%.},

Specifically, we examine human head and hand orientation motion signals, represented with quaternions, which are critical for correct viewing perspectives in virtual reality. Our experimental results and analysis indicate that unscented Kalman filtering performs equivalently with extended Kalman filtering. However, the additional computational overhead of the unscented Kalman filter and quasi-linear nature of the quaternion dynamics lead to the conclusion that the extended Kalman filter is a better choice for estimating quaternion motion in virtual reality applications.},

We compare these models in simulation in terms of quality of motions discovered, physical accuracy, and computation time. In each case, optimization is initialized by setting all decision variables to zero, namely, without a meaningful initial guess. For simulations, we consider a pushing manipulation task with varying complexity for a 7 degrees-of-freedom robot arm. Our results demonstrate that the optimization based on the proposed variable smooth contact model provides a good trade-off between the physical fidelity and the quality of motions discovered at the cost of increased computation time.},

  abstract = {Over the last 20-30 years, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has become the algorithm of choice in numerous nonlinear estimation and machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (e.g., learning the weights of a neural network). The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. [I] proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state-estimation. This was extended to parameterestimation by Wan and van der Menve [2, 31. The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity of O ( L \textasciitilde{} )f'or general state-space problems. When the EKF is applied to parameterestimation, the special form of the state-space equations allows for an (3(L2)implementation. This paper introduces the squareroot unscented Kalman jilter (SR-UKF) which is also U ( L 3 )for general state-estimation and U ( L 2 )for parameter estimation (note the original formulation of the UKF for parameter-estimation was U ( L 3 ) ) .In addition, the square-root forms have the added benefit of numerical stability and guaranteed positive semi-definiteness of the state covariances.},

  abstract = {Aims: This paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radio astronomy with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), with a focus on imaging observations. Methods: We have analysed the radio-frequency interference (RFI) situation in two 24-h surveys with Dutch LOFAR stations, covering 30-78 MHz with low-band antennas and 115-163 MHz with high-band antennas. This is a subset of the full frequency range of LOFAR. The surveys have been observed with a 0.76 kHz / 1 s resolution. Results: We measured the RFI occupancy in the low and high frequency sets to be 1.8\% and 3.2\% respectively. These values are found to be representative values for the LOFAR radio environment. Between day and night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. We find that lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of LOFAR results in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. At LOFAR's nominal resolution of 0.76 kHz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5\%. This rate increases approximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution. Conclusions: Currently, by using an automated RFI detection strategy, the LOFAR radio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. It remains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations that integrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. Reasons for the low impact of RFI are the high spectral and time resolution of LOFAR; accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and the proximity of the antennas to the ground. We discuss some strategies that can be used once low-level RFI starts to become apparent. It is important that the frequency range of LOFAR remains free of broadband interference, such as DAB stations and windmills.},

  title = {Wireless Distance Estimation with Low-Power Standard Components in Wireless Sensor Nodes},
  abstract = {In the context of increasing use of moving wireless sensor nodes the interest in localizing these nodes in their application environment is strongly rising. For many applications, it is necessary to know the exact position of the nodes in two- or three-dimensional space. Commonly used nodes use state-of-the-art transceivers like the CC430 from Texas Instruments with integrated signal strength measurement for this purpose. This has the disadvantage, that the signal strength measurement is strongly dependent on the orientation of the node through the antennas inhomogeneous radiation pattern as well as it has a small accuracy on long ranges. Also, the nodes overall attenuation and output power has to be calibrated and interference and multipath effects appear in closed environments. Another possibility to trilaterate the position of a sensor node is the time of flight measurement. This has the advantage, that the position can also be estimated on long ranges, where signal strength methods give only poor accuracy. In this paper we present an investigation of the suitability of the state-of-the-art transceiver CC430 for a system based on time of flight methods and give an overview of the optimal settings under various circumstances for the in-field application. For this investigation, the systematic and statistical errors in the time of flight measurements with the CC430 have been investigated under a multitude of parameters. Our basic system does not use any additional components but only the given standard hardware, which can be found on the Texas Instruments evaluation board for a CC430. Thus, it can be implemented on already existent sensor node networks by a simple software upgrade.},

Trajectory based analysis are based on the execution traces of the system or the simulation thereof. This family of methods is very appealing because of the simplicity of its execution, the possibility of having a partial verification, and its highly parallel structure.The key idea in this paper is the construction of local barrier functions with growth bound in local domains of validity. By using this idea, we can generalize our previous method that is based on the availability of global bisimulation functions. We also propose a computational scheme for constructing the local barrier functions and their domains of validity, which is based on the S-procedure. We demonstrate that our method subsumes some other existing methods as special cases, and that for polynomial systems the computation can be implemented using sum-of-squares programming.},

We also describe an initial, systematic effort to search for radio emission in low radio frequency images acquired with the Very Large Array (VLA). The limits set by the VLA images (\%300 mJy) are consistent with, but do not provide strong constraints on, the predictions of the model. Future radio telescopes, such as the Low Frequency Array and the Square Kilometer Array, should be able to detect the known extrasolar planets or place austere limits on their radio emission. Planets with masses much lower than those in the current census will probably radiate below 10 MHz and will require a space-based array.},

We examine the detectability of radio auroral emission from Proxima b, the closest known exosolar planet orbiting our nearest neighboring star, Proxima Centauri. Using the Radiometric Bode's Law, we estimate the radio flux produced by the interaction of Proxima Centauri's stellar wind and Proxima b's magnetosphere for different planetary magnetic field strengths. For plausible planetary masses, Proxima b produces 6-83 mJy of auroral radio flux at frequencies of 0.3-0.8 MHz for planetary magnetic field strengths of 1-3 B\$\_\{\textbackslash{}oplus\}\$. According to recent MHD models that vary the orbital parameters of the system, this emission is expected to be highly variable. This variability is due to large fluctuations in the size of Proxima b's magnetosphere as it crosses the equatorial streamer regions of the dense stellar wind and high dynamic pressure. Using the MHD model of Garraffo et al. 2016 for the variation of the magnetosphere radius during the orbit, we estimate that the observed radio flux can vary nearly by an order of magnitude over the 11.2 day period of Proxima b. The detailed amplitude variation depends on the stellar wind, orbital, and planetary magnetic field parameters. We discuss observing strategies for proposed future space-based observatories to reach frequencies below the ionospheric cut off (\$\textbackslash{}sim 10\$ MHz) as would be required to detect the signal we investigate.},

While they are not energy-preserving they do exhibit long-time stable energy behavior. However, variational integrators often simulate mechanical system dynamics by solving an implicit difference equation at each time step, one that is moreover expressed purely in terms of configurations at different time steps. This paper formulates the first- and second-order linearizations of a variational integrator in a manner that is amenable to control analysis and synthesis, creating a bridge between existing analysis and optimal control tools for discrete dynamic systems and variational integrators for mechanical systems in generalized coordinates with forcing and holonomic constraints. The forced pendulum is used to illustrate the technique.

The goal is to design, at each time step, a state-feedback control law that minimizes a `worst-case' infinite horizon objective function, subject to constraints on the control input and plant output. Using standard techniques, the problem of minimizing an upper bound on the `worst-case' objective function, subject to input and output constraints, is reduced to a convex optimization involving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is shown that the feasible receding horizon state-feedback control design robustly stabilizes the set of uncertain plants. Several extensions, such as application to systems with time delays, problems involving constant set-point tracking, trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection, which follow naturally from our formulation, are discussed. The controller design is illustrated with two examples.},

  abstract = {The motion of robots and objects in our world is often highly dependent upon contact. When contact is expected but does not occur or when contact is not expected but does occur, robot behavior diverges from plan, often disastrously. This paper describes an approach that uses simulation to detect possible such behavioral divergences on real robots. This approach, and others like it, could be applied to validation of robot behaviors, mechanism design, and even online planning. The particle trace approach samples robot modeling parameters, sensory readings, and state estimates to evaluate a robot's behavior statistically over a range of conditions. We demonstrate that combining even coarse estimates of state and modeling parameters with fast multibody simulation can be sufficient to detect divergent robot behavior and characterize robot performance in the real world. Correspondingly, this approach could be used to assess risk and find and analyze likely failures, given the extensive data that such simulations can generate.},

These constraints define a manifold of feasible states; while well understood mathematically, they pose numerical challenges to many algorithms for planning and controlling whole-body dynamic motions. In this paper, we present an approach to the synthesis and stabilization of complex trajectories for both fully-actuated and underactuated robots subject to contact constraints. We introduce a trajectory optimization algorithm (DIRCON) that extends the direct collocation method, naturally incorporating manifold constraints to produce a nominal trajectory with third-order integration accuracy---a critical feature for achieving reliable tracking control. We adapt the classical time-varying linear quadratic regulator to produce a local cost-to-go in the manifold tangent plane. Finally, we descend the cost-to-go using a quadratic program that incorporates unilateral friction and torque constraints. This approach is demonstrated on three complex walking and climbing locomotion examples in simulation.},

  abstract = {The Mars Global Reference Atmospheric Model  is an engineering-level atmospheric model widely used for diverse mission applications. Mars-GRAM has been utilized during previous aerobraking operations in the atmosphere of Mars. Mars-GRAM has also been used in the prediction and validation of Mars Pathfinder hypersonic aerodynamics, the aerothermodynamic and entry dynamics studies for Mars Polar Lander, the landing site selection process for the Mars Science Laboratory , the Mars Aerocapture System Study  as well as the Aerocapture Technology Assessment Group . Most recently, Mars-GRAM 2010 was used to develop the onboard atmospheric density estimator that is part of the Autonomous Aerobraking Development Plan. The most recent release of Mars-GRAM 2010 contains several changes including an update to Fortran 90/95 and the addition of adjustment factors. Following the completion of a comparison analysis between Mars-GRAM, Thermal Emission Spectrometer , as well as Mars Global Surveyor , Mars Odyssey , and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter  aerobraking density data, adjustment factors were added to Mars-GRAM 2010 that alter the input data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration  Ames Mars General Circulation Model  and the University of Michigan Mars Thermospheric General Circulation Model  for the mapping year 0 user-controlled dust case. The addition of adjustment factors resolved the issue of previous versions of Mars-GRAM being less than realistic when used for sensitivity studies for mapping year 0 and large optical depth values, such as tau equal to 3. Mars-GRAM was evaluated at locations and times of TES limb observations and adjustment factors were determined. For altitudes above 80 km and below 135 km, Mars-GRAM  densities were compared to aerobraking densities measured by Mars Global Surveyor , Mars Odyssey , and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter  to determine the adjustment factors. The adjustment factors generated by this process had to satisfy the gas law as well as the hydrostatic relation and are expressed as a function of height , Latitude  and areocentric solar longitude . The greatest adjustments are made at large optical depths such as tau greater than 1. The addition of the adjustment factors has led to better correspondence to TES Limb data from 0-60 km altitude as well as better agreement with MGS, ODY and MRO data at approximately 90-130 km altitude. Improved Mars-GRAM atmospheric simulations for various locations, times and dust conditions on Mars will be presented at the workshop session. The latest results validating Mars-GRAM 2010 versus Mars Climate Sounder data will also be presented. Mars-GRAM 2010 updates have resulted in improved atmospheric simulations which will be very important when beginning systems design, performance analysis, and operations planning for future aerocapture, aerobraking or landed missions to Mars.},

  abstract = {The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a staged experiment to measure 21 cm emission from the primordial intergalactic medium (IGM) throughout cosmic reionization (z = 6 - 12), and to explore earlier epochs of our Cosmic Dawn (z {$\sim$} 30). During these epochs, early stars and black holes heated and ionized the IGM, introducing fluctuations in 21 cm emission. HERA is designed to characterize the evolution of the 21 cm power spectrum to constrain the timing and morphology of reionization, the properties of the first galaxies, the evolution of large-scale structure, and the early sources of heating. The full HERA instrument will be a 350-element interferometer in South Africa consisting of 14-m parabolic dishes observing from 50 to 250 MHz. Currently, 19 dishes have been deployed on site and the next 18 are under construction. HERA has been designated as an SKA Precursor instrument. In this paper, we summarize HERA's scientific context and provide forecasts for its key science results. After reviewing the current state of the art in foreground mitigation, we use the delay-spectrum technique to motivate high-level performance requirements for the HERA instrument. Next, we present the HERA instrument design, along with the subsystem specifications that ensure that HERA meets its performance requirements. Finally, we summarize the schedule and status of the project. We conclude by suggesting that, given the realities of foreground contamination, currentgeneration 21 cm instruments are approaching their sensitivity limits. HERA is designed to bring both the sensitivity and the precision to deliver its primary science on the basis of proven foreground filtering techniques, while developing new subtraction techniques to unlock new capabilities. The result will be a major step toward realizing the widely recognized scientific potential of 21 cm cosmology.},

  abstract = {This paper presents numerical methods for computing regions of finite-time invariance (funnels) around solutions of polynomial differential equations. The methods are compared on stabilized trajectories of a six-state model of a satellite. First, we present a method which exactly certifies sufficient conditions for invariance despite relying on approximate trajectories from numerical integration. Our second method relaxes the constraints of the first by sampling in time. On the model system, this recovered almost identical funnels but was much faster to compute. In both cases, funnels are verified using Sum-of-Squares programming to search over time-varying quadratic Lyapunov functions. We examine both time-varying rescalings of quadratic forms computed from linearizations and searching directly over timevarying quadratic Lyapunov functions. On the model system the latter provided larger funnels at the cost of increased computation time.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {A widely recognized shortcoming of model predictive control (MPC) is that it can usually only be used in applications with slow dynamics, where the sample time is measured in seconds or minutes. A well-known technique for implementing fast MPC is to compute the entire control law offline, in which case the online controller can be implemented as a lookup table. This method works well for systems with small state and input dimensions (say, no more than five), few constraints, and short time horizons. In this paper, we describe a collection of methods for improving the speed of MPC, using online optimization. These custom methods, which exploit the particular structure of the MPC problem, can compute the control action on the order of 100 times faster than a method that uses a generic optimizer. As an example, our method computes the control actions for a problem with 12 states, 3 controls, and horizon of 30 time steps (which entails solving a quadratic program with 450 variables and 1284 constraints) in around 5 ms, allowing MPC to be carried out at 200 Hz.},

The parameterized form of the controllers produced by EPC coupled with online uncertainty estimates ensures this robust constraint satisfaction property persists even as the system switches controllers and experiences variations in the uncertainty model. We validate the online performance and robust constraint satisfaction of the proposed Robust EPC algorithm through a series of experimental trials with a small quadrotor platform subjected to changes in state estimate quality.},

The problem involves vehicles with independent dynamics but with coupled constraints to capture required cooperative behavior. Using a recently-developed form of DMPC, each vehicle plans only for its own actions, but feasibility of the sub-problems and satisfaction of the coupling constraints are guaranteed throughout, despite the action of unknown but bounded disturbances. UAVs communicate relevant plan data to ensure that decisions are consistent across the team. Collision avoidance is used as an example of coupled constraints and the paper shows how the speed, turn rate and avoidance distance limits in the optimization should be modified in order to guarantee robust constraint satisfaction. Integer programming is used to solve the non-convex problem of path-planning subject to avoidance constraints. Numerical simulations compare computation time and target arrival time under decentralized and centralized control and investigate the impact of decentralization on team performance. The results show that the computation required for DMPC is significantly lower than for its centralized counterpart and scales better with the size of the team, at the expense of only a small increase in UAV flight times.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

  abstract = {In this note an intrinsic version of the Cram\textbackslash{}'er-Rao bound on estimation accuracy is established on the Special Orthogonal group \$SO(3)\$. It is intrinsic in the sense that it does not rely on a specific choice of coordinates on \$SO(3)\$: the result is derived using rotation matrices, but remains valid when using other parameterizations, such as quaternions. For any estimator \$\textbackslash{}hat R\$ of \$R\textbackslash{}in SO(3)\$ we give indeed a lower bound on the quantity \$E(\textbackslash{}log(R\textbackslash{}hat R\^T))\$, that is, the estimation error expressed in terms of group multiplication, whereas the usual estimation error \$E(\textbackslash{}hat R-R)\$ is meaningless on \$SO(3)\$. The result is first applied to Whaba's problem. Then, we consider the problem of a continuous-time nonlinear deterministic system on \$SO(3)\$ with discrete measurements subject to additive isotropic Gaussian noise, and we derive a lower bound to the estimation error covariance matrix. We prove the intrinsic Cram\textbackslash{}'er-Rao bound coincides with the covariance matrix returned by the Invariant EKF, and thus can be computed online. This is in sharp contrast with the general case, where the bound can only be computed if the true trajectory of the system is known.},

This strategy exploits solution information of the previous QP under the assumption that the active set does not change much from one QP to the next. Furthermore, we present a modification where the CPU time is limited in order to make it suitable for strict real-time applications. Its performance is demonstrated with a challenging test example comprising 240 variables and 1191 inequalities, which depends on 57 parameters and is prohibitive for explicit MPC approaches. In this example, our strategy allows CPU times of well below 100ms per QP and was about one order of magnitude faster than a standard active set QP solver},

Here, we report that the secret to the gecko's arboreal acrobatics includes an active tail. We examine the tail's role during rapid climbing, aerial descent, and gliding. We show that a gecko's tail functions as an emergency fifth leg to prevent falling during rapid climbing. A response initiated by slipping causes the tail tip to push against the vertical surface, thereby preventing pitch-back of the head and upper body. When pitch-back cannot be prevented, geckos avoid falling by placing their tail in a posture similar to a bicycle's kickstand. Should a gecko fall with its back to the ground, a swing of its tail induces the most rapid, zero-angular momentum air-righting response yet measured. Once righted to a sprawled gliding posture, circular tail movements control yaw and pitch as the gecko descends. Our results suggest that large, active tails can function as effective control appendages. These results have provided biological inspiration for the design of an active tail on a climbing robot, and we anticipate their use in small, unmanned gliding vehicles and multisegment spacecraft.},

  title = {An Efficient Acyclic Contact Planner for Multiped Robots},
  doi = {10.1109/TRO.2018.2819658},
  abstract = {We present a framework capable of producing contact plans describing complex multiped motions (including humanoid): standing up, climbing stairs using a handrail, crossing rubble and getting out of a car. Our framework answers a need demonstrated at the Darpa Robotics Challenge, where the lack of an automatic acyclic contact planner was recognized a major issue. Our novel key idea is the reachability condition. Informally, it verifies that the root configuration of a robot is " close, but not too close " from obstacles: close to allow contact creation, not too close to avoid collision. With this approximation of the space of admissible root configurations we decompose the hard contact planning problem into simpler sub-problems: first, to plan a guide path for the root without considering the whole-body configuration; then, to generate a discrete sequence of whole-body configurations in static equilibrium along this path. The reachability condition turns the high-dimensional computation of the guide into a collision checking problem, solved in less than a few seconds. Then a deterministic contact selection algorithm tackles the combinatorial issue of generating of a discrete sequence along the guide path. Several innovations make it computationally efficient: a criterion for verifying static equilibrium, and a set of heuristics used to enforce desirable properties on the configuration. Our approach results from the pragmatic choice of favoring efficiency over exhaustiveness, justified empirically: in a few seconds, with satisfying success rates, we generate complex contact plans for various scenarios and robots, namely HRP-2, HyQ, and a dexterous hand.},

For researchers that work in the intersections of machine learning, robotics, control, and optimization, such relations are highly relevant but sometimes hard to see across disciplines, due also to the different notations and conventions used in the disciplines. The aim of this tutorial is to introduce to constrained trajectory optimization in a manner that allows us to establish these relations. We consider a basic but general formalization of the problem and discuss the structure of Newton steps in this setting. The computation of Newton steps can then be related to dynamic programming, establishing relations to DDP, iLQG, and AICO. We can also clarify how inverting a banded symmetric matrix is related to dynamic programming as well as message passing in Markov chains and factor graphs. Further, for a machine learner, path optimization and Gaussian Processes seem intuitively related problems. We establish such a relation and show how to solve a Gaussian Process-regularized path optimization problem efficiently. Further topics include how to derive an optimal controller around the path, model predictive control in constrained k-order control processes, and the pullback metric interpretation of the Gauss\textendash{}Newton approximation.},

This hyperfine transition of HI is sensitive to the thermal and ionization state of hydrogen gas and thus provides a tracer of sources of energetic photons \textendash{} primarily hot stars and accreting black holes \textendash{} which ionize and heat the high redshift intergalactic medium. Sky-averaged spectra of the redshifted 21-cm background are expected to exhibit broad absorption and emission features relative to the microwave background at low radio frequencies, {$\approx$}40-120 MHz. In a low altitude lunar orbit, night-time spectral observations while on the farside avoid terrestrial radio frequency interference, ionospheric corruption, and solar radio emissions. The distinctive frequency structure, uniformity over large scales, and unpolarized state of the redshifted 21-cm spectrum are distinct from the spectrally featureless, spatially-varying and polarized emission from bright Galactic foregrounds. This allows a clean separation between the primordial signal and foregrounds using Bayesian inference techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We illustrate how this signal can be detected in the presence of foregrounds using the instrument parameters for the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE), and to subsequently constrain the properties of the high-z intergalactic medium and the parameters of a simple first stars model.},

  abstract = {Battery-free, energy-harvesting devices operate using energy collected exclusively from their environment. Energyharvesting devices allow maintenance-free deployment in extreme environments, but requires a power system to provide the right amount of energy when an application needs it. Existing systems must provision energy capacity statically based on an application's peak demand which compromises efficiency and responsiveness when not at peak demand. This work presents Capybara: a co-designed hardware/software power system with dynamically reconfigurable energy storage capacity that meets varied application energy demand. The Capybara software interface allows programmers to specify the energy mode of an application task. Capybara's runtime system reconfigures Capybara's hardware energy capacity to match application demand. Capybara also allows a programmer to write reactive application tasks that pre-allocate a burst of energy that it can spend in response to an asynchronous (e.g., external) event. We instantiated Capybara's hardware design in two EH devices and implemented three reactive sensing applications using its software interface. Capybara improves event detection accuracy by 2x-4x over statically-provisioned energy capacity, maintains response latency within 1.5x of a continuously-powered baseline, and enables reactive applications that are intractable with existing power systems.},

We compare the full-step variants of our algorithms and present several simulation examples, including a high-dimensional underactuated robot subject to contact switches. Simulation results show that our multiple-shooting algorithms can achieve faster convergence, better local contraction rates and much shorter runtimes than classical iLQR, which makes them a superior choice for nonlinear model predictive control applications.},

The new hybrid method incorporates nonlinear mathematical programming techniques to increase efficiency: quadratic programming subproblems are solved via trust region and range-space active set methods, an augmented Lagrangian cost function is utilized, and a multiphase structure is implemented. In addition, the algorithm decouples the optimization from the dynamics using first- and second-order state transition matrices. A comprehensive theoretical description of the algorithm is provided in this first part of the two paper series. Practical implementation and numerical evaluation of the algorithm is presented in Part 2.},

This paper presents ALTRO (Augmented Lagrangian TRajectory Optimizer), a novel algorithm for solving constrained trajectory optimization problems that bridges this gap by offering fast convergence, numerical robustness, and the ability to handle general nonlinear state and input constraints.

  doi = {10.1109/AERO.2017.7943648},
  abstract = {As a spacecraft becomes smaller, a number of physical effects scale both favorably and unfavorably for passive stabilization of the craft. Unfortunately, two separate quantities both scale unfavorably for the use of traditional spinning rotor actuators (e.g. reaction wheels, momentum wheels, control moment gyros) for momentum and attitude control. First, the dominant disturbance torques on small spacecraft in low earth orbit, aerodynamic drag and solar radiation pressure, both become relatively larger as spacecraft size decreases. Second, the effectiveness of spinning rotors reduces as the rotor inertia decreases with the square or the wheel radius. These two factors conspire to greatly reduce the effectiveness of rotor-based momentum control systems at small scales. This reduction requires small spacecraft designers to either devote a significantly larger mass fraction to momentum control or adopt alternative momentum control systems. In this study we examine this problem from two viewpoints. First, empirical data is used to find a relationship between spacecraft size and mass fraction devoted to attitude control. While the International Space Station can devote less than 1\% of its mass fraction to momentum control effectors, GEO telecom spacecraft tend to need around 1-2\% of available mass, and some CubeSats must devote greater than 50\% of their mass fraction. Second, we derive an expression for the smallest spacecraft that can use a reaction wheel for effective momentum management. For reasonable assumptions, this lower limit is on the order of 1 cm length scale, which is in good agreement with the empirical trend. Finally, we list some alternative momentum management strategies and discuss how they apply to spacecraft at the smallest size: the centimeter scale ChipSat.},

In the outer loop, two coordinates of the angular rate vector are considered as virtual controls and designed to asymptotically stabilize the quaternions and the third angular rate. In the inner loop, robust sliding mode controller is designed in terms of the control torque inputs to accurately track the command profiles produced by the outer loop controller. Stability of the outer loop is proved using LaSalle's and Floquet's theorems. A numerical example is considered. Theoretical results are confirmed via computer simulation.},
